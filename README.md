Population-wide normative reference models for cerebellar growth 
------------------------------------------------------------------

This repository contains the normative models for cerebellar growth in anatomical and functional regions-of-interest as described by Gaiser et al. 2023 [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.26.538263v1).
See individual directories for further details.

Both linear as well as b-spline models can be downloaded and used as informative priors for new unseen sites using the [PCNtoolkit](https://github.com/amarquand/PCNtoolkit.git). 
A detailed account of how normative models can be implemented in future studies can be found [online](https://pcntoolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and is also described by Gaiser, Berthet and colleagues [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.02.530742v1).
